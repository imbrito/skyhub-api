# Resize Photos â€“ SkyHub Challenge
Your mission:

+ Consume a webservice endpoint `http://54.152.221.29/images.json` that returns a JSON of photos. There are 10 photos.

+ Generate three different formats for each photo. The dimensions are: small (320x240), medium (384x288) and large (640x480).

+ Write a webservice endpoint that lists (in JSON format) all the ten photos with their respective formats, providing their URLs.

You should use a non-relational database (MongoDB is preferred).

# Why use Rails?

Rails is a Ruby framework for web development. Rails provides an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, and can be used for back-end and front-end development. Like Ruby, Rails also shares the gem repository (Rails is a gem), which increases your productivity.
